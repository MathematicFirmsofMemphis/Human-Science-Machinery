### Explanation of the Data:
- **Coordinates (X, Y, Z):** Each line following the molecular formula provides the X, Y, and Z coordinates of an atom in 3D space.
- **Element Type:** After the coordinates, the atom type is specified (e.g., S for sulfur, C for carbon, N for nitrogen, H for hydrogen).
- **Additional Columns:** The remaining columns typically contain additional properties or flags used in chemical software for further processing.

## Conclusion
The `.mol` file gives a detailed structural representation of the molecule by providing both the atomic composition and the 3D arrangement of atoms. This information can be used for further molecular modeling or chemical analysis.
